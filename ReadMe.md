Swarup Sahu Hi everyone,
Some of you might be seeing an odd error in some of you files whereby you see something along the following:
version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
oid sha256:8d67928172c22992bac4f9849c6b97c0e7a57c117933ad87096bfe36ef2ef999
The reason why you are seeing this is because your git lfs was not installed correctly in your initial system setup. To resolve you can follow something suggestions made by my peers in different classes. Delete your current repo, install git lfs, and then re -clone seems to be the approach to correct this. I am also going to create a new channel - channel 09 - strictly for git issues. If you have any git issues moving forward, please post there!  (edited)

# Python Pandas

- How to slice data, foreach use case:
	- df[["column1", "column2"]]
	- df.loc[]
	- df.iloc[]

- How to group data
	- .groupby() . <list of applicable functions>




# Cheat sheets - linear regression - TODO get this validated with the TA's and instructor.

- LinearRegression.score: model score
- r2 = residual squared [0, 1]. Best >0.9
- mean squared error: Measure of error. Relative
- RMS error: Relative to data [0, 2 ??] 
- STD: Standard deviation

(Swarup Sahu) R^2 is basically a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. 100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean. In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data (doesn't always mean its a good thing). Thats probably the most important indicator.

Joseph McHugh Having a square as opposed to the absolute value function gives a nice continuous and differentiable function (absolute value is not differentiable at 0) - which makes it the natural choice, especially in the context of estimation and regression analysis.

## F1 Score (from Joseph McHugh)

Here is how F1 score is calculated
it is technically a measure of accuracy, but instead of taking the total number of true positives and dividing by the total number of samples, it performs this convoluted calculation above
7:47 PM
why not just use accuracy?
7:48 PM
because oftentimes you’ll find your data isnt balanced, if you had a 50/50 split of diabetes and non-diabetes, the simple way of calculating it would be appropriate

# Notes from Unit 14 - Day 1
- Good rule of thumb: Use a triple the amount of hidden nodes as the number of inputs.
- Neural network: 
- Activation function: 
- Use the following activation functions for a neural network:
	- reloid: Initial input
	- sigmoid: Generating output
- Designing a good neural network is part science part art.
- Ways to increase accuracy of a neural network:
	- Add more hidden nodes (make the network deeper)
	- Add more [iterations?]
- One-hot encoding: Transforms classification data into numerical data.
- Standardization: De-meaning the variables so each variable has a mean of 0 and variance of 1. This results in the variables being approximately the same effective "size" from the perspective of the model.

- Dimensionality reduction (DCA or PCA??) can be used to reduce the complexity of the problem to make it run faster.


# Notes from Unit 14 - Day 2
- Activation function: 
- Loss function: ? computing accuracy?
- Optimizer: Updates the weights to help the loss function minimize the error.
- Deep neural networks
- Possible to tell that the model is overfitted when: Test accuracy is much lower than training accuracy
- Code:

	validation_split: Reserves fraction of input data for validation. Alternative to train_test_split.

- NN optimization
	- Loss function rate of decrease should be high, to indicate that the loss function is working well.
- Reduce overfitting by:
	- Using PCA to reduce number of features.
	- Adding more nodes to each layer.
	- Adding more layers may cause overfitting.
	- Dropout layer can help with overfitting.
	- Embedding layer ...

# Class Notes - 12/21/2020 - 14-3
- ANN vs. RNN
	- ANN has no memory of events?
	- ANN is linear.
	- RNN has a feedback loop.
- LSTM (Long short-term memory)
	- Applies weights to the sequences of data which will be rememebered more than others; whereas RNN forgets things in sequence.
- Example code:
	- Model setup
		- embedding_size: Best to be a multiple of 8.
	- binary_crossentropy loss function: Used to account for binary output values.
	- batch_size = Speed with which the training will operate.
	- epochs = Number of iterations.
	- Encoding layer: Provides interpretation of encoded numerical data.
- LOC curve
- ROC curve
- How to interpret the accuracy of different models.
- Time series modeling
	- Dropout enforces random dropping of neurons per run.
	- return_sequence: Tells the model how to reconnect itself?
	- shuffle=False: Ensures input data order is retained.

Hassan Naeem @channel please complete the following steps prior to class Monday:
goto https://walletgenerator.net/?currency=Testnet%20Bitcoin and generate a wallet.
take your public address key, should start with letter ‘m’ and private key and load into a notes file for saving
goto https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/send.php and enter your address that starts with ‘m’  into the address field and request .00092 BTC.
Taking these steps should ensure that you have a funded account in preparation for class on Monday. Thank you! (edited)

# Unit 19-03 Notes
* Only new UTXO's can be spent. Then they take a lot longer to validate. Then they can no longer be spent??
* BTC UTXO's accounting mechanism is better than ETH's accounting mechanism because:
** It is faster and takes fewer resources.
** It supports multiple transaction outputs.

I love this guide so much, I've been referring to it for years 😍

I'd like to suggest adding jq which is a superb tool in many developers' belt these days. Basically all you have to do is:

Download the latest Windows executable of your choice from https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases
Put it in your Git\mingw64\bin folder
Rename to jq.exe

Suggestion: At the beginning of all slides referring to the ML breakdown, show the breakdown chart about ML -> Supervised/Unsupervised -> Regression/Classification etc. (already in place in some but not all slide decks)

Where does Deep Learning fit in with unsupervised models in the ML breakdown? Or is it AI?

Recommendations
* Include more Tableau practice as this is asked for in the industry.
* Include more OO development as this is asked for in industry and differentiates someone from being a run-of-the-mill python script writer. Include this and unit testing and full stack dev in a more technical route.
